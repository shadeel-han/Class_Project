View2See is a recommendation system for best-viewing location of sightseeing spots.
Our team proposed and built this project during the 2013 Trend Micro Big Data Innovation 
Programming Contest. Team members are ´¿¤åª@(Vincent), ³Å©Ó³ó(David), ½²¨Ø¯¾(Vivi) and
me Áú¬F§Ê(Shadeel). We were all National Taiwan University students at that time.

Several years has passed and View2See has gone. This repository is in memory of our past 
glory, so I only put a Chinese version proposal and a presentation slide here. If someone 
is interested in this project and recall it to life in the future, please remember to 
cite this repository. We'll be thankful to you for your appreciation of View2See.

The size of presentation slide is too large to put on GitHub. For original pptx version,
please visit https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9svuB4khUv0b0pGOER4NGdxT1E/view?usp=sharing
