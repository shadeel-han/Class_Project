This project tries to calculate the number of Staphylococcus and Escherichia in 
microscopic images. It could only be run on Windows familiy operating system since it 
was manufactured under Visual Studio for using the .Net framework and its UI component.

Exection files(.exe) locate in /FinalProject/Debug or /FinalProject/Release.
Under author's test, they could be successfully opened on Wiondows XP and 7.
Operation is quite simple in the following:

(1) "OpenImg" files in /Images.
(2) "Methos1" calculate the number of only Staphylococcus.
(3) "Methos2" calculate the number of Staphylococcus and Escherichia but should be
    used only on /Images/A+B.bmp.
(4) The snapshots of execution results are put in /Result.
